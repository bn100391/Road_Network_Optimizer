# Road_Network_Optimizer

## Overview: üó£Ô∏è  

This project takes a network of roads and models it as a graph, where intersections are nodes and roads are edges. It
then analyzes and optimizes this graph to determine the most efficient way to connect all points using the least amount
of material and effort. Using graph optimization techniques, the program finds an optimal layout‚Äîsuch as a minimum
spanning tree‚Äîthat ensures all locations are connected while minimizing total construction cost or distance. At a high level,
this project explores how graph algorithms can be applied to solve real-world infrastructure problems in a more efficient and
cost-effective way.
